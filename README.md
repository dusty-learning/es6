# ES6

Or also known as ECMAScript 6 which is the current standard of JavaScript before ES2017 becomes official.

This repos purpose is to give you a run down quickly of what exactly es6 introduces, and how to use it.

Do note that this is on going, we've currently only touched the tip of the iceburg for some of the features in ES6

## Following along

If you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, the latest Safari) You can open up your dev tools and follow some of the examples right in your console since these browsers support es6 features.

## More Info

If you would like to see a working example added to the repo please feel free either open an issue or message me on the slack channel about it and I will happily create one!

If you have a question that you didn't feel was answered, do the same open an issue with your question and I will do my best to provide an answer and then add it to the repo!

This is an on going concept as stated above.
