# Working Examples

These examples are considered to be working examples that you can easily run just using `node` on the JavaScript file. Their main objective is to give you a working example that you can freely tinker around with and modify to your hearts content to hopefully help in giving you a better understanding of the ES6 version of JavaScript.

## How To Run Examples

**Important** The below will work for every example **BESIDES** The library example since it is built as a functional library you need to build a test file that will import and use the library and then run node on **THAT** file.
