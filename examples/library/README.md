# Library

This implements basically everything this repo has shown you. I consider this a "Hard" example to read over since a whole lot of stuff is going on at the same time here.

This example is of a library I pulled directly out of one of my own projects ([DustyJs](https://github.com/dhershman1/dustyjs))

It takes everything this repo talked about and applies it into an organized and functional based library. You can run this library to by downloading it and checking out some of the functionality yourself (I can't guarantee everything works 100% due to the fact that some of the functionality in DustyJs is going through re writes)

Check out the example JS to see the JavaScript of the library And see if you're able to follow along the ES6 structure.
