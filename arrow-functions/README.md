# Arrow Functions

The next prominent feature I'm sure you've seen through ES6 is the use of arrow functions

Arrow functions give us the ability to create single line functions, simpler methods, and simpler function expressions all in a little arrow.

They also give support to a `lexical this` which means if you are in need to use the `this` keyword your scoping won't go all bonkers, and you no longer need to do that silly setter of `var self = this;` all the time.

It's important to note that single line arrow functions are called `Expression Bodies`, where multi line arrow functions are called `Statement Bodies`

Showing you is a lot easier than trying to explain all the terminology, so let's hop into the examples.
